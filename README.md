# HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI

# üí° Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, aimed at providing actionable insights into employee data to improve HR decision-making processes. The dashboard is designed to analyze critical HR metrics such as employee performance, attrition, job satisfaction, and salary trends to help organizations identify factors influencing employee turnover, improve retention strategies, and align HR practices with business goals.

By visualizing key HR data points, the dashboard enables HR teams and business leaders to make data-driven decisions that can lead to improved workforce management and better business outcomes.


# üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- Power BI: The primary tool for creating the dashboard, visualizations, and data models.
- Power Query: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation before loading data into Power BI.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures, calculated columns, and KPIs to facilitate deeper insights.
- Excel: Used for initial data exploration and preparation before importing into Power BI.


# üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains key employee metrics that are essential for HR analysis. It includes the following variables:

- Employee Demographics: Age, gender, job role, education level, etc.
- Performance Metrics: Job satisfaction, performance ratings, years at the company, work-life balance, etc.
- Attrition Data: Attrition status (i.e., whether an employee left the company), reasons for leaving, and retention rates.

# Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query:
  Open Excel and connect to your employee data
  Use Power Query to clean and transform the data
  Create a copy template for one sheet in Power Query transformations and apply the same transformations to all sheets
  Apply all necessary cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types
  Create a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition
  Encapsulate all steps into a function to be reused for future sheets and data
  Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI
  
# Exploring and Manipulate Some Data Using DAX Query:
  With DAX Query, we can effectively manipulate and analyze the data to provide insights for visulization and identify areas for improvement for HR.
  Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum function for exploring some clean data for improve dashboard KPI in PowerBI.

# Power BI Dashboard Visualization:
  Design the dashboard layout
  Create a measure table to aggregate and display the data using Dax functions
  Use Visulizations for charts and filters for filter dashboard
  Now, Add Title HR Dashboard
  Add Month column as Slicer and add some informative KPI.
  Add Bar chart, Pie chart, Column chart, Cards, Matrix chart, Donut chart etc
